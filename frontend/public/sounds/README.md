# Notification Sounds

## How to Add Your Own Notification Sound

1. **Supported Formats**: MP3, WAV, OGG, or any browser-supported audio format
2. **Recommended Duration**: 1-3 seconds for best user experience
3. **File Size**: Keep under 100KB for fast loading

## Steps to Add Custom Sound:

1. **Download or create your notification sound file**
2. **Rename it to `notification.mp3`** (or your preferred format)
3. **Place it in this `sounds` folder**
4. **The app will automatically use your custom sound**

## Default Behavior:

- If no custom sound file is found, the app will use a built-in beep sound
- Users can control volume and enable/disable sounds in Settings
- Sound settings are saved in the user's browser

## Example Sound Files You Can Use:

- **Short notification chime** (recommended)
- **Gentle bell sound**
- **Soft ping or beep**
- **Custom branded sound**

## Testing:

- Use the "Test Sound" button in Settings to preview your sound
- Make sure the sound is appropriate for different environments
- Consider users who might be in quiet spaces

## Note:

The app will automatically fall back to a built-in beep sound if your custom audio file fails to load or play.
